## Kinect for Azure Setup 
The hardware synchronization of the Kinect for Azure devices is much easier as the required synchronization cables are standard 3.5-mm audio cables. [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kinect-dk/multi-camera-sync) provide a detailed description of the cables and the hardware cables configuration between multiple devices.

# Hardware Sync
We take into serious account the fidelity of our multi-view data during the capturing phase. The simultaneous triggering of all acquisition processes between different cameras is realized with external hardware synchronization cables. In case you need more detailed description regarding the hardware synchronization cables visit our 
[Synchronization Cables Section](https://github.com/VCL3D/VolumetricCapture/wiki/Synchronization-Cables).

# Kinect Azure Hardware Synchronization Cables
### Parts List
 * Cables:
    * (N - 1) x 3.5-mm audio cable for N Kinect Azure Sensors (daisy chain configuration). 
    * N x 3.5-mm audio cable for N Kinect Azure Sensors (star configuration).
 * Headphone Splitter (Optionally, if star configuration is used)

### Instructions
The cables should be less than 10 meters long and can be stereo or mono.
You can choose one of the following configuration for you multi-view setup.
